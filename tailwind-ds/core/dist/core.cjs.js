// this file is slightly different to some others though
// it has a require hook which compiles your code with Babel
// this means that you don't have to set up @babel/register or anything like that
// but you can still require this module and it'll be compiled

// this bit of code imports the require hook and registers it

// aren't compiled with the require hook in case you have some other require hook
// or something that should be used on other modules
